    <h1>Data Analysis Using Blueberry</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blueberry is a bio-sensing computer that is attached to an eyeglass, which collects biological signals to track physical and mental states.</li>
      <li>We analyzed five key metrics from Blueberry: HbO (oxyhemoglobin), HbR (deoxyhemoglobin), flowActivity (a representation of changes in blood flow over a 10â€“20 second period), heartRate (beats per minute), and flowIntensity (a composite representation of blood flow changes and cardiovascular indicators such as heart rate).</li>
      <li>The data came from a session where a person read <em>The History of the Future: Oculus, Facebook, and the Revolution That Swept Virtual Reality</em> by Blake J. Harris and took notes, with their notes, a CSV file, and a screen recording provided.</li>
      <li>We used Google Colab, a software that allows us to run Python and work together, and a few libraries like pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the data.</li>
    </ul>

      Looking at this graph, we can infer many things. For example, when looking at the HbO levels throughout the 12 minutes, you can see several sharp peaks and dips. This represents changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration due to brain activity, which is most likely due to taking notes and processing information. Oddly, when the person first starts taking notes at 43 seconds, HbO drops almost immediately after. This is weird because, as we just stated, taking notes requires brain power, increasing brain activity as a result. If you zoom in more closely, you can clearly see that HbO drops at 48 seconds, which indicates a muscular response event. More interestingly, if you take a look at around 51 seconds, there is a sharp peak showing that the muscular response event actually caused an increase in HbO, showing that the person probably noticed something important in the reading.

    <ul style="margin-top: 1em; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>HbR mirrors HbO, showing an inverse relationship. When oxyhemoglobin increases, deoxyhemoglobin decreases, which is typical in brain activity.</li>
      <li>The flowActivity, heartRate, and flowIntensity data all reflect the mental engagement of the reader. For example, a spike in flowActivity can show active comprehension, while flat regions indicate passive reading.</li>
      <li>Since flowIntensity looks a lot like flowActivity, and it is a composite of both heartRate and flowActivity, we can assume that flowActivity dominates.</li>
    </ul>

      After a few days, we received another drive folder, this time having a screen recording and a CSV file of a person playing a pattern recognition game.
